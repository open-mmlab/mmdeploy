Note We do not recommend using GLOB to collect a list of source files from your source tree.
If no CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or removed then the generated build
system cannot know when to ask CMake to regenerate. The CONFIGURE_DEPENDS flag may not work
reliably on all generators, or if a new generator is added in the future that cannot support it,
projects using it will be stuck. Even if CONFIGURE_DEPENDS works reliably, there is still a cost
to perform the check on every rebuild.
